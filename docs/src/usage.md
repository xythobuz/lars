# Usage Guide

Turn on LARS using the power switch on the PCB.

In normal operation, the bottom of the display always shows the battery level in percent, and the voltage.
Take care to **turn off the device** and recharge it when the **percentage reaches zero**!

The top of the screen shows the currently selected setting and its value.
Press the encoder to switch to the next available setting, or turn the encoder to change the value of the currently selected setting.

The available settings depend on the current mode.
Take a look at the sub-page for each mode for details.

You can hold down some buttons while powering on the device to get different effects:

* hold the `Clear` button to enter the configuration menu
* hold the encoder `Click` button to show version information of the firmware
* hold both `Clear` and `Click` to enter the button test mode
* hold any combination of three buttons to skip the boot animation
