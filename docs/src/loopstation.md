# Loop Station

In this mode the first three buttons play each corresponding output channel.

The fourth button, with the LED always lit, is the record button.
Hold it down for a while and release it to set the length of the loop.

Notes played while the record button is held will be looped.

The top-right button below the encoder clears the recorded loop in different ways:

 * Pressing it on its own will clear all channels of the current loop, keeping the set length.
 * Presssing it while holding down one of the channel mute buttons will clear only this channel in the current loop.
 * Pressing it while holding down the left REC button will clear the current loop, including the length.
 * Pressing it while holding down the right REC button will clear all loops in all banks.

You can modify the loop length using the encoder menu.

The encoder menu also provides a way to switch between different loop banks.
With the `Sel-Bnk` menu you can switch to another loop bank.
With the `Cpy-Bnk` menu you can copy the current loop to another bank and switch to it.
