# Loop Station

In this mode the first three buttons play each corresponding output channel.

The fourth button, with the LED always lit, is the record button.
Hold it down for a while and release it to set the length of the loop.

Notes played while the record button is held will be looped.

The top-right button below the encoder clears the recorded loop.

You can modify the loop length using the encoder menu.
